 # This Repo is about completing the task

## How to run tests on your local machine:

 The first step you need to run application on your local machine. 
 Please refer to the public repository hosted here: [application](https://github.com/sparingsoftware/qa-form)

After this step is done and you application is up an running you can go to next steps for Playwright installation.

 Clone the repository via:

 ```bash 
 HTTPS: https://github.com/miloszqa/p-prog-pw.git
 ```

 or you can use 
 
 ```bash 
 SSH: git@github.com:miloszqa/p-prog-pw.git
 ```

 Once it is done open the folder directory:

 ```bash
 cd p-prog-pw
 ```

 Install nodejs, you can do that by using NVM on Mac or Windows:
 
 ```bash 
 MacOS:
 Install homebrew manager: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 ```

 After homebrew is installed install nvm:
 ```bash
 homebrew: brew install nvm
 ```

Once this step is done you can install nodejs. For this project we are going to use v16.20.2 which needs to be installed. Tests should work on every nodejs version but to make life easier we can use the specific version.

```bash
install: nvm install 16.20.2
```
If you completed this step make a command to use this particular nodejs version

```bash
nvm use 16.20.20
```

or Windows users:

You have to download nvm from nvm-windows [repository](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
