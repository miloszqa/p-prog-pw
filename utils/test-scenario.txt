Test Objective: Verify Ability to cover form registration, validate mandatory fields

Preconditions: User is on the registration page (localhost)

(note here: I didn't want to make it step-by step automation as I tried to play around some functions, methods, loops making it a bit more independent and less flaky)

Steps:
- Navigate to homepage
- Verify mandatory fields (listed in the Array) and error messages
- fill up proper data
- Include one checkbox which is mandatory
- Submit the form
- Verify landing on the next page
